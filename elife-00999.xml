    <body>
        <p>Infectious diseases continue to be responsible for a substantial proportion of deaths
            worldwide and there is evidence for a significant increase in the number of outbreaks
            over the past 30 years. Although some of this increase may be due to improved detection
            and reporting, animal diseases that can be transmitted to humans are among the major
            causes of human infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Smith et al.,
            2014</xref>).</p>
        <p>Influenza outbreaks are a particular concern: in the UK, for example, the potential
            impact of an influenza pandemic has been identified as the highest priority in the
                <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"
                xlink:href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-risk-register-for-civil-emergencies-2015-edition"
                >UK Government Risk Register for 2015</ext-link>. Our current inability to predict
            which specific virus subtypes will trigger the next influenza pandemic highlights the
            vital importance of addressing gaps in the knowledge base. Research on a wide range of
            topics&#x2014;including the study of virus transmission, host range, drug resistance,
            infectivity, immunity and virulence&#x2014;is urgently needed to fill these gaps. In
            this article we focus on the issues raised by proposals to use
            &#x2018;gain-of-function&#x2019; experiments to fill some of these gaps. Such
            experiments have a long history of providing useful information in virology.</p>
        <p>Gain-of-function experiments involve modifying a virus and analysing the link between
            modified genotype and phenotype. However, proposals to modify the H5N1 variant of the
            influenza virus in order to affect its transmission potential, and thereby understand
            the factors that determine the ability of an animal virus to spread to humans (and
            between humans) by the aerosol route, were controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                rid="bib9">Russell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"
                >Schultz-Cherry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Palu,
                2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Wain-Hobson, 2014</xref>), and there
            is still a de facto moratorium on such research in the US.</p>
        <disp-quote>
            <p>Self-regulation is a necessary first step for gain-of-function research, but this
                does not mean that each researcher is free to decide for themselves what procedures
                to follow.</p>
        </disp-quote>
        <p>Experiments are of concern if they have the potential to cause serious disease, and these
            concerns encompass biosafety (relating to the accidental release of a pathogen from
            containment), biosecurity (relating to intentional misuse; see <xref ref-type="bibr"
                rid="bib6">NRC, 2004</xref>), and bioethics (the principles and their place in
            research review procedures). Although potentially dangerous research studies are already
            subject to stringent regulations in many countries, recent controversies prompted the
            European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC) to set up a working group to examine
            the issues raised by gain-of-function research and to make recommendations for the
            management of such research and its outputs in the EU <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"
                >Figure 1</xref>. This working group contained the present authors and other
            scientists with a wide range of relevant experience. Here we discuss some of the
            recommendations made by the working group (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">EASAC,
                2015</xref> for the full report).</p>

                    <title>Making PhD programmes better and shorter</title>
                </caption>
                <p>To explore how things might be done differently, let us compare two highly
                    regarded PhD programmes—the Watson School of Biological Sciences at Cold Spring
                    Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), and the ‘Tetrad’ program at my own institution, the
                    University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)—with the average for all graduate
                    programmes. Two points stand out. First, significantly more of the students
                    entering the CSHL and UCSF programmes obtained PhDs, and significantly more also
                    opted for a career in research, which suggests that a large majority of
                    ‘average’ programmes recruit less able students and/or train them poorly.
                    Second, the time taken to obtain a PhD was notably shorter at CSHL—just 4.6
                    years, compared with 6.5 years at UCSF and 6–7 years on average.</p>
            </boxed-text>
            <p>Moreover, proposals for gain-of-function studies&#x2014;particularly those that
                intend to alter virus transmission, host range, drug resistance, infectivity,
                immunity and virulence&#x2014;have to be justified by their authors to a wide range
                of bodies (the institutions where the work will be carried out, the agencies that
                will fund the work, the relevant ethics committees, and the relevant national
                authorities), as well as their peers, on a case-by-case basis. This process must
                involve a thorough analysis of the risks and benefits of the research being
                proposed. Researchers also need to demonstrate that the information they need can
                only be obtained from gain-of-function experiments.</p>
            <disp-quote>
                <p>A clear theme in both Europe and the US is the need for the scientific community
                    to engage more broadly with the public, explaining the reasons for doing
                    gain-of-function research.</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <p>There are many uncertainties in the data used to evaluate benefit and risk, and this
                can lead to controversy. It should also be acknowledged that potential benefits of
                research are sometimes overstated by scientists: however, it is also true that the
                benefits of research might only become clear much later. Views vary on whether
                benefit should be quantified in terms of future public health impact or described in
                terms of the generation of knowledge, and on the extent to which benefits may be
                lost if research is not allowed. There have been concerns that research that could
                help to streamline the production of vaccines might suffer if gain-of-function
                experiments are banned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cohen, 2015</xref>; <xref
                    ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ping et al., 2015</xref>). Because of the multiple
                challenges involved in assessing risk and benefit, the EASAC report concludes that
                any benefit-risk analysis cannot be regarded as a &#x2018;once and for all&#x2019;
                calculation, and that all the relevant parties need to understand and communicate
                the issues on an on-going basis.</p>
            <p>The EASAC report also recommends that there is no need for a new advisory body at the
                EU level. Rather, all EU Member States should have a clear national advisory
                mechanism on procedures for assessing and managing biosafety and biosecurity risks.
                In the UK, for example, the Health and Safety Executive has statutory powers, but
                other EU Member States have different mechanisms and not all have statutory powers.
                There is need to harmonise the implementation of good practice in these respects.
                All countries should also adopt a &#x2018;layered&#x2019; approach with researchers,
                research institutions, research funders and national authorities all being
                responsible for the regulation of gain-of-function research. Such a layered approach
                at the country level will spread good practice, increase accountability, and help to
                improve public trust in research.</p>

            <p>Researchers and institutions also have to recognise their responsibility to make
                decisions about publishing sensitive information and, together with funders, ethics
                committees and others, need to consider these issues throughout the research
                process, starting when the research is first proposed, rather than delaying the
                decision until a manuscript is ready for submission to a journal. The oversight
                within the scientific community must involve journals and professional societies, as
                well as researchers, their funders and institutions (and national advisory bodies in
                complex cases). Journal editors in the US recently came to a similar conclusion
                    (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Casadevall et al., 2015</xref>). Regarding the
                question of what to do when European researchers submit a manuscript to a journal
                that is not based in Europe, EASAC advises that the use of the EU&#x2019;s export
                control regime is an inappropriate and ineffective vehicle to block such
                submissions.</p>
            <p>Many of EASAC&#x2019;s recommendations have been welcomed by the European Commission,
                who will now consider how to incorporate EASAC advice into guidance for Horizon 2020
                research grant applicants and evaluators.</p>
            <p>The EASAC report resonates with the themes that are emerging from discussions in the
                US involving the National Academies, the National Science Advisory Board for
                Biosecurity (NSABB) and the National Institutes of Health. A <ext-link

                    >National Academies workshop</ext-link> in December 2014 observed that the
                challenges involved in regulating gain-of-function research were international, that
                attention should be focussed on those experiments of greatest concern, that
                researchers and their institutions must accept responsibility, and that analysing
                the risks and benefits is not straightforward. Since then, a quantitative
                risk-benefit analysis has been initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2"
                    >Casagrande et al., 2015</xref>), and the NSABB has set up a working group to
                look into the issues surrounding gain-of-function research (<xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bib5">Kanabrocki, 2015</xref>). In its interim report the NASBB working
                group noted that the US already has a robust policy framework for the regulation of
                research, and any future policies should build on this framework.</p>

        <sec id="s2">
            <title>Challenges for wider engagement</title>
            <p>A clear theme in both Europe and the US is the need for the scientific community to
                engage more broadly with the public, explaining the reasons for doing
                gain-of-function research, discussing the potential risks and benefits of this
                research, and explaining the biorisk management practices adopted. Engagement with
                public interests can be considered at three levels. First, on the global scale, the
                scientific community has to ensure that the public health benefits that arise from
                innovation based on gain-of-function research are made available to everyone.
                Second, on the national level, scientists need to convince the public that taxpayer
                funds are being spent wisely  (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Third, on a local level, scientists must engage with
                those who live near research facilities to reassure them about safety.</p>

            <p>Another clear theme is the need for the regulatory authorities, funding bodies and
                professional societies in different countries to work together to share expertise in
                the regulation of gain-of-function research and in risk-benefit analysis. Academies
                of science have a clear role to play at the national level, and international
                networks of academies can bring scientists from different countries together to
                study and make recommendations on specific issues: the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"

                is an example of this.</p>
            <p>Influenza pandemics are currently unpredictable. However, we still need to be ready
                for the next pandemic, and that includes being in a position to perform
                gain-of-function research if that is the only way to obtain the information needed
                to deal with the pandemic. And, as should be clear from above, this means that many
                different stakeholders&#x2014;scientists, institutions, funding agencies, ethics
                committees, national regulatory authorities, scientific societies and
                journals&#x2014;need to work together to ensure that we are prepared.</p>

                    and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent

            <p>Thank you for submitting your article, "What defines 'priority of discovery' in the
                life sciences" to for consideration as a Feature Article. Your article has been
                discussed by two Deputy Editors and Peter Rogers (the Features Editor). </p>
            <p> The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor
                has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. </p>
            <p>You need to make sure the XML structure you creates works on the display of the PMC
                platform and also that there is enough information contained within the tagging to
                generate a typeset PDF from the XML with no additional information provided.</p>

            <p>However, some decisions required some communication with PMC to discuss whether any
                of our updates could be accomodated by them - during this review we aimed to reduce
                the complexity of the XML structure and remove all formatting and bioler plate text
                required for a PDF display format.</p>
            <p>If an author referes to a reference in the response letter it is cross linked to the
                reference in the reference list, however, if it is a new reference only cited in the
                decision letter or author response it is not added to the main reference link and is
                just listed as free text, for example, Butcher et al, 2006. If the author provides
                the reference it can be added as free text to the end of the letter, however, this
                is not a requirement.</p>
